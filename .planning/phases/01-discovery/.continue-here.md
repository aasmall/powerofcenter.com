# Continue Here: Phase 1 Discovery

**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Status**: Research complete, waiting on Squarespace credentials

## What We Did

1. Analyzed powerofcenter.com - Hugo static site on GCS
2. Found contact form uses Getform.io (no spam protection)
3. Decided on "Cloudflare Everything" approach (free tier)
4. Completed DNS research:
   - Registrar: Squarespace Domains
   - Current NS: Google Cloud DNS
   - A Record: 35.190.19.2 (GCP)
   - No MX/TXT records (clean slate)

## What's Blocking

- Need Squarespace Domains credentials from mom
- Aaron texting her tonight, will walk through tomorrow

## Next Steps (When We Resume)

1. Log into Squarespace Domains (with mom's creds or screen share)
2. Create Cloudflare account (can use mom's email or Aaron's)
3. Add powerofcenter.com to Cloudflare
4. Get CF nameservers
5. Update NS in Squarespace → Cloudflare
6. Wait for propagation (~5-30 min)
7. Enable Bot Fight Mode

Then proceed to Phase 3: Worker + Email

## Mom Talking Points

- "Your contact form is getting spammed, real messages are lost"
- "I'll move your site behind Cloudflare - free, more secure"
- "Just need your Squarespace login to change one setting"
- "Site will keep working, just better protected"
