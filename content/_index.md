# About my work

My work is based on the assumption that joy is our natural state of being and
that our suffering comes from resisting what is, and painful programming can be
mistaken for who we are. This is the false self. This process, this art of
transformation can help allow our True Self to emerge and learn to be free from
the past memories that hinder your happiness in the present moment.
